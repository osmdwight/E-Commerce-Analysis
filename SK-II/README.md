**a premium Japanese skincare brand, owned by Procter & Gamble (P&G), famous globally for its luxurious products**. In 2025,  they launched multiple set of products and a new set of vouchers for their customers can  use.

Now that they’ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing strategy, the company would like to build more understanding of their revenue stream and the effectiveness of vouchers they produced for the year 2025. It has two primary objectives: 1)_to increase the overall revenue_, and 2) _to maximize voucher effectiveness and cost efficiency_

## Insights Summary
---
In order to evaluate and reach the goal, I focused on the following key metrics:

* **Revenue**: The Monthly comparison of the overall generated revenue
* **Cart to Checkout Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who added items to their cart and completed a purchase.
* **Viewer to Buyer Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who viewed a store page or product and completed a purchase.
* **Redeemed Revenue**: Revenue generated from vouchers
* **ROI**: A multiplier that shows how much return is generated from discounted items relative to their cost.
* **Discount Cost**: The amount saved by the customer using the voucher.
* **Collected and Reedemed Rate**: The percentage of people who claimed the voucher and redeemed or used the voucher that was collected

**Revenue**
  * The monthly average revenue  was RM953K, ranging from RM311k to RM2.15M. November got the highest generated revenue (RM2.15M) while January got the lowest revenue with RM311K.
  * While November had the highest revenue, March had the highest increase of revenue with 254.57% vs previous month
  * March and November are in peaks due to Lazada Special Events such as Epic Birthday Sales in Lazada Malaysia and 11.11 promo

**Cart to Checkout Conversion Rate**
  * Across the month, August got the lowest conversion rate record with only 25.98% of items being purchased after it was added to customers cart.
  * November had the highest units added to cart but was able to outperformed other months, caused by special event
  * Overall the average conversion rate was 32.18%  for all months

**Viewer to Buyer Conversion Rate**
   * Across the month, March got the highest conversion rate  record with 1.49% of visitors pruchased atleast one item.
   * Not surprisingly, the month of May and November got the two highest record of visitors. While, January had the lowest visitors
   * Overall the average conversion rate was 0.82% across all month.
     
**Redeemed Revenue and ROI**
  * Across the month, November generated RM1.6M revenue from vouchers, highest among all months.
  * Surprisingly the month of April had the highest ROI with a record of 19.14x
  * Intrestingly, it was almost breakeven for the month of May with an ROI of 1.06x
  * 89% of overall revenue comes from vouchers (_RM8.9M_)
    
**Discount Cost**
 * May voucher had the highest discount cost summing up to RM887k (_94% of Redeemed Revenue_)
 * RM1.47M was the total discount cost for year 2025 ( _16.48% of the total redeemed revenue_)
 * In average RM122k is being discounted from all items each month
 
**Collected and Reedemed Rate**
  * Interestingly, even May generated the lowest ROI it has low redeemed rate (_4.14%_).
  * January has the lowest issued voucher
  * In average 26.5% of issued vouchers are being collected and only 5.29% are used or redeemed.

## Recommendations
---
 * **Maximize contents and promotion campaigns for every special Lazada Events**: such as Epic Birthday Sale (March )and double date campaigns (9.9-12.12). These type of events significantly boost sales and visitor value as seen on month of March (Epic Birthday Sale) and November (11.11)
 * **Simplify the checkout process and eliminate hidden charges**: Review the checkout funnel to ensure full pricing transparency. Unexpected fees or a complex checkout process may discourage purchase completion and contribute to drop-offs at the final stage.
 * **Improving the landing pages (Product and Home)**: The number of visitors indicates that the product or page is getting noticed but with low conversion rate, indicates insufficient product information, low reviews or pricing issue. Enhancing content quality, social proof (high reviews) and optimized pricing on landing pages
 * **Personalized the voucher offerings**: Categorize the customers, dividing them into different groups based on their demographics, behaviors, and other factors to offer the right vouchers to the right people.
 * **Follow up notifications**: via email or platform messageto remind the customer the time they have to use the voucher. Redeem rate is below average as some customer often forget to use their voucher. Reminding customer will help to maximize the voucher
 * **Balance out the voucher discount cost**. The issued voucher should just be enough to atleast reach 2x ROI from the discounted cost. Rebalance the issued voucher especially for the month of May, where it only returns a 1.06x profit.
